BiDi stands for bidirectional text.

Rāghava-Yādavīyaṁ is a 30 verse Sanskrit poem that can be read in both the directions, ie. from left-to-right and from right-to-left.

From left-to-right, it describes Śrī Rāma (Rāghava) and in reverse Śrī Kr̥shṇa (Yādava.)

These programs written in Go and Python 
  1. take the text in its ASCII transliteration using the Harvard-Kyoto convention as input.
  2. Create a JSON object for each verse with the forward (anuloma) and reverse (pratiloma) readings.
  3. Compare these strings to make sure they are the reverse of each others.
